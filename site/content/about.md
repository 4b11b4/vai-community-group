About Vai CG

“We are not separated by land, but we are connected by water” – anonymous

Vai is a word meaning water.  
Vai/Water unites and connects our Pacific Islander communities together.

It is therefore the mission of Vai Community Group to bring the Pacific Island community together by supporting Pacific Islander businesses and building community resilience through cultural preservation by highlighting arts, dance, and sport.  

Vai Community Group also seeks to create space to talk about Pacific Island issues, youth mentoring, climate change, as well as health and fitness.
