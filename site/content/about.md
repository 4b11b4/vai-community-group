Vai is a word meaning water. Vai/Water unites and connects our Pacific Islander communities together.  It is therefore the mission of Vai Community Group to bring the Pacific Island community together by supporting Pacific Islander businesses, build community resilience with cultural preservation highlighting arts, dance, and sport. Vai Community Group also seeks to create space to talk about Pacific Island Issues, Youth Mentoring, Climate Change, as well as health and fitness.
